Photica Photopulse

Photopulse was a commercial Java desktop application from Photica
that created animated Flash slideshows from photos and music.
It includes a keyframe based pan/zoom editor and a number
of transitions and effects.

It is being open sourced under the MPL 1.1 license.


* Building

Photopulse is optimized for Windows, it includes some native Windows only
JNI components for WMV video export and Flash animation in-application preview.
Also the help system uses Microsoft HTMLHelp format and the application
launcher is a Windows EXE.

A private JRE is bundled with the application installer, the ant script
checks that it is being built with the same version of Java which is 1.5.0_04.
To build with a different version of Java pass
  -Dphotopulse.java.required.version=1.X.X_XX
to ant to specify the version.

The native components are included precompiled, they can be rebuilt using
Visual Studio using ant:
  ant bin

To build the Windows installer from a tag use:
  ant -Dexport.tag=X.Y.Z export-installer


The application can also be built and run on Mac OS X, without the
native components. Use the ant task:
  ant -Dphotopulse.java.required.version=1.5.0_16 run-wizard

* Modifying

The effects and transitions are built using JGenerator using Macromedia
Generator 2 templates. Generator is now defunct, and the templates could
only be created using the Flash 5 authoring environment.
So this is kind of a dead end. But there's other interesting pieces
in Photopulse.
