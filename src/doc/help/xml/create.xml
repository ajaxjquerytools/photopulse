							Turning on high quality mode will help make pan and zoom effects
							smoother and clearer.
							However, it will make the show file size much larger,
							and the show will take longer to create.
							Normally, high quality mode would only be used for video show types.
							Sometimes you may want to turn it off even for video shows,
							to speed up show creation time.
							The <guilabel>High quality</guilabel> checkbox is automatically
							set properly based on the show type you select,
							so normally you will not need to change it.

										<para>
											Creates an HTML web page that contains a Flash show.
											The <guilabel>File Name</guilabel> that you enter will be
											the name of an HTML file that contains a thumbnail of
											the first photo in your show.
											The user can click this thumbnail to popup another web browser
											window that is the proper size to play your show.
											The popup HTML page and the Flash file and other data will
											be created in a separate folder that is named after the
											web page file name you enter.
											For example, if you enter <filename>Graduation.htm</filename>
											in the <guilabel>File Name</guilabel> field, then the web page
											<filename>Graduation.htm</filename> will be created and also
											a folder named <filename>Graduation_files</filename> which
											will contain the Flash file, thumbnail and popup web page.

										<para>
											Creates a Windows Media video file.
											The video file can be quite large,

									<listitem>
										<para>
											Creates a Windows application which a user can run to play
											back your show. The application contains an embedded Flash file
											of your show, so the application itself is all that is needed to
											play back the show.

											a Flash presentation using the Macromedia Flash authoring tool,
											or who are building their own HTML page to host the Flash file.
